# Zenji Features Reference

> This document serves as a comprehensive reference of all implemented features in the Zenji VS Code extension. Use this as a guide when developing new features to maintain consistency with the existing architecture.

## üîç Overview

Zenji is a mindful AI coding companion VS Code extension designed to promote mental wellness for developers. The extension offers a range of features including focus timers, ambient sounds, journaling, and mindfulness tools to help developers maintain balance during coding sessions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Zenji is built as a VS Code extension with a WebView-based UI. The architecture consists of:

1. **Extension Core** - TypeScript code that handles the VS Code integration, manages data persistence, and controls the WebView lifecycle.
2. **WebView UI** - HTML/CSS/JS-based dashboard with multiple tabs for different features.
3. **State Management** - Uses VS Code's state API for persisting user data locally.
4. **Cloud Sync** - Optional functionality to synchronize user data across devices.

## üå± Onboarding Experience

The onboarding flow consists of a multi-step wizard that introduces users to Zenji:

1. **Welcome Screen** - Features a logo and tagline with animated transitions.
2. **Name Input** - Captures the user's name with validation.
3. **Profile Picture** - Allows avatar upload or selection of default avatar.
4. **Completion** - Confirmation screen with the option to enter the Zenji dashboard.

Key implementation files:
- `resources/webviews/onboarding/onboarding.html` - Onboarding UI
